<h3>Simple but not Simplistic</h3>
<p>
	Coffee is the seed of a tropical fruit. The best coffees, to our mind, are the ones that remind us of that fact. Bright, sweet, vibrant, layered, complex, ripe, and balanced. These characteristics describe the coffee we are constantly striving to achieve. Preparing a cup of coffee, at its core, is a simple task. But preparing a more perfect cup of coffee is a constant chase and its quite a thrilling one at that. Coffee is the most chemically complex food that humans consume. Brewed coffee has upwards of 900 volatile aromatic compounds, more than double that of wine. Yet often, coffee is thought of as having only one purpose - to wake you up in the morning. While that is a wonderful perk, it is hardly all coffee is good for. Coffee has such incredible diversity of flavors to be explored and appreciated. Come explore with us! But dont worry. If you just need to get a delicious cup of coffee and get on with your day, you can do that here too. No worries.
