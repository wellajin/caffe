<h3>Our Values</h3>
<p>
	1.) HOSPITALITY IS PARAMOUNT- hospitality and hostile come from the same Latin root word, hostis. Hostis meant stranger or enemy. Hostility is what takes a stranger and turns them into an enemy. Hospitality, then, is the art of transforming strangers into friends. <br>
 
    2.) QUALITY OFFERED HUMBLY- we believe in quality in all its facets. From ingredients, to preparation, to service: quality is not negotiable. Furthermore, quality products and service must be offered with humility. A haughty spirit will only take away from the quality we seek. <br>

    3.) MAKE ROOM FOR EVERYONE- we will make room at our table for everyone.<br> 

    4.) CREATE COMMUNITY- we seek to encourage and foster community in our spaces. Furthermore, we seek to engage and serve the communities in which we work. <br>
